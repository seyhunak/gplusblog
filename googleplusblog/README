This project allows you to use Google+ as the backend of a blog
---------------------------------------------------------------

This project requires:

  * Google AppEngine SDK
  
    http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html
  
  * Google+ API
  
    http://code.google.com/p/google-api-python-client/
    
Installation
------------

Follow the installation instructions for the Google AppEngine SDK from here:

    http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstarted/
    
To get running easily, copy the following directories from the Google+ API archive into your project (underneath the /src folder):

apiclient/
gplus/
httplib2/
oauth2client/
uritemplate/
gflags.py
gflags_validators.py

Copy settings.py.example as settings.py.  You can get the information required in that file as follows:  

1. Go to:
   https://code.google.com/apis/console
2. select choose your project.
3. Choose 'API Access'
4. If you have not generated a client id, do so.
5. Make your callback:
  http://localhost:8080
  
You will need your own Google+ ID, which you can get from the URL of your Google+ profile.

For example, within my Google plus URL:

https://plus.google.com/107330528562005281406/posts

My Google+ ID is: 

107330528562005281406
